"""

In a binary tree, a lonely node is a node that is the only child of its parent node. The root of the tree is not lonely because it does not have a parent node.

Given the root of a binary tree, return an array containing the values of all lonely nodes in the tree. Return the list in any order.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4]
Output: [4]
Explanation: Light blue node is the only lonely node.
Node 1 is the root and is not lonely.
Nodes 2 and 3 have the same parent and are not lonely.
Example 2:


Input: root = [7,1,4,6,null,5,3,null,null,null,null,null,2]
Output: [6,2]
Explanation: Light blue nodes are lonely nodes.
Please remember that order doesn't matter, [2,6] is also an acceptable answer.
Example 3:



Input: root = [11,99,88,77,null,null,66,55,null,null,44,33,null,null,22]
Output: [77,55,33,66,44,22]
Explanation: Nodes 99 and 88 share the same parent. Node 11 is the root.
All other nodes are lonely.
Example 4:

Input: root = [197]
Output: []
Example 5:

Input: root = [31,null,78,null,28]
Output: [78,28]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
Each node's value is between [1, 10^6].
